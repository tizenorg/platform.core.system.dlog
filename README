This is a README for dlog, Android logging system adapted
for TIZEN.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Function and purpose
--------------------

This is a logging subsystem collecting events from system and/or
applications.
It is based on four circucular buffers implemented in kernel
and accessible by device nodes in /dev :

/dev/log_system
/dev/log_radio
/dev/log_main
/dev/log_events

It consists of three parts:
- user space library (libdlog) providing functions 
  amd macros for writing logs
- user space daemon (dlogutil) and tool that:
  reads logs, stores in files, rotates, applies filters etc.
- user space tool (dlogctrl) that controls level and kind
  of collected logs
- kernel module implementing buffers and devices

The size of buffers are hardcoded in kernel.
(4*256 kB /drivers/staging/android/logger.c)

systemd journal
---------------

If dlog is configured and build with flag: 
--with-systemd-journal
it writes logs to journal instead /dev/log_* device nodes.
It uses sd_journal_send function.

How to use
----------

libdlog
-------

Every component that can generate logs should be linked to
libdlog library and include dlog.h header.
There are defined iset of macros that are used to write logs:
LOG[DIWE], SLOG[DIWE], RLOG[DIWE], ALOG[DIWE]
These are used for different buffers and priorities.

LOG[DIWE] - logs to 'main'
SLOG[DIWE] - logs to 'system'
RLOG[DIWE] - logs to 'radio'
ALOG[DIWE] - logs to 'apps'

The last character determines priority of a message:

D - Debug
I - Info
W - Warning
E - Error

If 'system' or 'apps' device does not exists
logs are redirected to 'main'.
It is possible to add a tag, for this purpose
one should define a macro LOG_TAG in source code
containing name of tag before header dlog.h is included.

dlogutil
--------

Usage: dlogutil [options] [filterspecs]

options include:

  -s              Set default filter to silent.
                  Like specifying filterspec '*:s'

  -f <filename>   Log to file. Default to stdout

  -r [<kbytes>]   Rotate log every kbytes. (16 if unspecified). Requires -f

  -n <count>      Sets max number of rotated logs to <count>, default 4

  -v <format>     Sets the log print format, where <format> is one of:
                  brief(by default) process tag thread raw time threadtime long

  -c              clear (flush) the entire log and exit, conflicts with '-g'

  -d              dump the log and then exit (don't block)

  -t <count>      print only the most recent <count> lines (implies -d)

  -g              get the size of the log's ring buffer and exit, conflicts with '-c'

  -b <buffer>     request alternate ring buffer
                  ('main' (default), 'radio', 'system')");

filterspecs are a series of 
  <tag>[:priority]

where <tag> is a log component tag (or * for all) and priority is:

  V    Verbose

  D    Debug

  I    Info

  W    Warn

  E    Error

  F    Fatal

  S    Silent (supress all output)

'*' means '*:D' and <tag> by itself means <tag>:V
If no filterspec is found, filter defaults to '*:I'

The one dlogutil process could write logs to one file,
if more files are needed more dlogutil processes should be run.

Examples:

dlogutil -r 1024 -n 3 -f /var/log/dlog -v time *:W

  Rotate log every 1024 kbytes.
  The max number of rotated logs are 3.
  Logs are written to /var/log/dlog
  The format of logs is 'time'.
  Logged are messages with all tags and priority Warn or above.

dlogutil -b radio -v time -f /var/log/seq.radio.log -r 1000 -n 10

  Read logs from /dev/log_radio.
  The format of logs is 'time'.
  Logs are written to /var/log/seq.radio.log
  Rotate log every 1000 kbytes.
  The max number of rotated logs are 10.
  Logged are messages with all tags and priority Info or above.

dlogctrl
--------

Usage: dlogctrl {get|set} platformlog [0|1]

Gets or sets platformlog option which determines
whether logs with lower id than LOG_ID_APPS are written.
(0 - no, 1 - yes)

dlogtests
---------

Usage: dlogtests

Perform embedded selftests.

# Dlog configuration file.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# Following file configures dlog library.
# First section contains global configuration for library.
# It allows to disable or enable platform logs and log limiter features.

PlatformLogs                   on        # Possible values are 'on' and 'off'
LogLimiter                     off

# Second section controls filtering rules for dlog limiter.
# Each line represent a rule for a filter. Filtering is done
# at runtime, but configuration is read only at the boot time.
# Log lines filtered out are not written to log buffers.
# Filtering is done for "TAG"|priority pair, where TAG is string defined by application.
# Which should be quoted with '"' character. It may contain spaces but not TABs.
# Priority is one character from the following values:
#
#     V or v or 1 - Verbose messages,
#     D or d or 2 - Debug messages,
#     I or i or 3 - Informational messages,
#     W or w or 4 - Warning messages,
#     E or e or 5 - Error messages,
#     F or f or 6 - Fatal messages.
#
# Limiter can define rules 'for all' by using an '*' character.
# It's a wildcard replacing all TAGs not mentioned in this file.
# '*' could be used also as wildcard for priority.
# An asterisk is not evaluated, which means rules like "WOR*" are threated as a TAGs.
# Log filter works according to rules presented below:
#
# case 1) The "TAG"|priority pair is not presented on the list.
#       - Use "TAG"|* rule to decide what to do.
#       - If "TAG"|* is not defined, use "*"|priority rule to decide what to do.
#       - If "*"|priority pair is not present, use "*"|* rule.
#       - If rule "*"|* is not present, then allow logging.
#
# case 2) The "TAG"|priority pair is on the list (applies to
#         "*" |priority and "*"|* rules).
#       - If policy = ALLOW, then log speed is unlimited.
#       - If policy = <number> then limit to <number> logs per minute.
#       - If policy = DENY then forbid logging.
#
# Maximum <number> is 10000, which gives 10000 log line per minute.
# Please keep in mind that dlog uses constant size log storage, thus
# when the application writes many logs, it may cause older entries overwriting.
#
# The configuration file has following format:
# Lines beginning with # are threated as comments.
# TAG can contain any ASCII letter or digit and spaces, but
# not a TAB character. TAG has to be quoted using '"' character.
# TAG is separated from priority with pipe '|' character.
# Priority is one character long, the possible values are presented above.
# Policy is separated from the "TAG"|priority pair with TAB character.
# Policy is expressed as ALLOW, DENY or number from 0 to 10000 (not case sensitive).
# Setting policy as 0 is the same as DENY.
# Setting policy to more than 10000 is threated as allow.




# TAG|priority	POLICY
